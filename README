CodeWriter - This Class translates VM language commands into assembly language.

Parser -  Handles the parsing of a single .vm file, and encapsulates access to
the input code. It reads VM commands, parses them, and provides convenient
access to their components. In addition, it removes all white space and
comments.

Utils - This class consists of constants and dictionaries for the usage of
other classes.

Main - Main gets a directory path or a .vm file's path from the command line:
* In the case the input is a directory path - Main translate all of the .vm
  files in the directory into one Assembly file.
* Otherwise: It translate the given file into an Assembly file.

Summary
-------
This is a virtual machine -
An abstract computer that serves a part in the translation of high level
programing language into a machine language. The high level language is
translated into VM language and the VM language is translated into Assembly.
